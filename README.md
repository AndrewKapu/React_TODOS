# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## npm start

I'm using webpack, so this command will start webpack-dev-server. For more info watch webpack.config.js.
